# filer

The `filer` R package provides functions for easily constructing paths and querying for files that may or may not be compressed (with .gz extension).

## Installation

You can install filer from [GitHub](https://github.com/OchoaLab/) using the R commands:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("OchoaLab/filer")
```

## Example

The default mode of `filer` is to construct file path strings:

```{r example}
# a file with standard .txt extension:
filer('myfile')

# change extension
filer('myfile', 'pdf')

# no extension
filer('myfile', '')

# compressed version
filer('myfile', gzip=TRUE)

# compressed and different extension
filer('myfile', 'yml', gzip=TRUE)

# compressed but no other extension
filer('myfile', '', gzip=TRUE)

# no special treatment for periods in name (not assumed to be existing extensions)
filer('myfile.blah')
filer('myfile.blah', '')
```

There are two modes that make this much more useful in practice.
Both of these test for file existence, looking for compressed files when the regular versions don't exist, and let you know when neither files are found.

First is the "logical" mode, which returns a boolean for whether a file exists.
